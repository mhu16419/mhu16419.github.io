## Abstract

The growing attention to deep learning in malware detection is due to its performance. With the increasing cyberattacks on IoT devices, it is necessary to extend malware detection across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). However, training deep learning models is challenging due to the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of collecting and labeling sufficient malware samples for each ISA.

We propose leveraging Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) to reduce data collection burden. Malware from one ISA can be translated to an ISA with sufficient samples (e.g., X86-64), allowing a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another. Our approach reduces data collection effort by enabling cross-ISA malware detection with a single-ISA trained model.
