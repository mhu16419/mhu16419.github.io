## Project Overview

Designed and implemented a complete machine learning pipeline that processes data, trains models, and serves predictions in real-time. The system handles data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment with full monitoring and observability.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Data Processing**: Apache Kafka for streaming data ingestion
- **Model Training**: Automated training pipeline with hyperparameter optimization
- **Model Serving**: RESTful API with automatic scaling
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and metrics collection
- **A/B Testing**: Framework for comparing model versions

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Celery
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark, Pandas
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## Results

- Reduced prediction latency by 60%
- Improved model accuracy by 15%
- Achieved 99.9% uptime
- Processed 1M+ predictions per day

## Lessons Learned

This project taught me the importance of:
- Designing for scale from the beginning
- Implementing comprehensive testing strategies
- Building observability into every component
- Planning for failure and recovery scenarios
